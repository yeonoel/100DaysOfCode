# debugging

Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding problems and fixing them.

Problems in code typically come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running,
 runtime errors where your code behaves unexpectedly, or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.

In this course, we will learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common problems before they occur.
