# 100 Days Of Code


The creation of this repository was inspired by Alex Kallaway's challenge
to code in either java, python and/or JavaScript for at least one hour 
every day for 100 days. I decided to take this challenge to reach some goals while working full time on my Alx projects. I will use this repository to store code and thought processes.
